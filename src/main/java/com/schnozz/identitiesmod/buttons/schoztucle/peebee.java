    // hello
    //i bet youre wondering how i got here
    //this is me, deleting all your code
    //if your upset, please file a complaint in our handy complaint box
    //in order to access the complaint box, you will have to get into a white van and ride it for about 1 and half hours
    //with a bunch of strangers, then hike to the top of a mountain for about another hour and half or so
    //and finally, you'll have to spend about 34 hours solving riddles who's answer is always "rock"
    //to find the complaint box at the top of the mountain
    //but well really bond through this experience
    //like a lot
    //like cry in eachothers arms kinda deal
    //well learn about eachothers broken marriages and struggles with substance abuse
    //eachothers fetishes
    //like that one guy who had a sexual relationship with his car on that my strange addiction show
    //and at the end of it, you wont even find the complaint box
    //you'll leave knowing that the real complaint box was the friends you made along the way


    //anyway
    //holy shit its late
    //im gonna talk about my girlfriend
    //actually i dont think i want a bunch of twinkish coding loser high school boys to know about my girlfriend
    //and i dont care that youre "technically a graduate"
    //youre mother probably wipes your ass for you
    //but shes really cool
    //like shes in a band thats actually kinda good
    //and shes got a dog named rat
    //and shes funny as hell
    //shes almost like if one of them little white cocaine dogs got reincarnated with human responsibilities
    //full of anxiety and shaking all the time
    //practically frothing at the mouth and giving you rabies or smth
    //but at the end of the day if you give that puppy some sick sun glasses and put it in a little bag
    //shit rocks
    //her birthday's coming up soon too, im excited abt that imma go visit her in nc
    //shes not from there but her parents moved there the moment she graduated high school
    //so be weary
    //you, too, could have your parents become so high on the freedom of your absence that they sell all of your earthly belongings and flee to the countryside
